be ready to create helper functions that remove redundant code. this should be obvious, but i mean everything, even strings you write.
using fetch in multiple places is not good practice. use your own API service layer.

when styling a website, you must create some unification. create hard coded space sizes in your code. create specific colors.

if you could, create simple tests for your api.

every error should notify the user: "https://react-hot-toast.com/"

constantly look for data that you can combine into one. instead of using 3 useState for 1 component, combine them into 1 for example.
